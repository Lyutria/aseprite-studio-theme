# Usage
Download the latest `.aseprite-extension` from the Releases page, open, and it should automatically open and ask to install in Asesprite. You can change themes from `Edit -> Preferences -> Theme -> "Studio"`

If Aseprite won't install it automatically, go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions`, click **Add Extension** in the bottom left and select the `studio-theme.aseprite-extension` you downloaded.

Want to use a higher resolution font? Pixellari is included in the files. Hit **Open Folder** in Aseprite's theme settings, open `theme.xml` in your preferred text editor, and follow the instructions at the top of the file which will walk you through changing it to use Pixellari instead.
